# Create and retrieve a list and cards in Trello

This example demonstrates how to use the Trello API with Ballerina to:

- Create a new list on a specified Trello board.
- Fetch the created list by its ID.
- Add a card to that list
- Retrieve all cards from that list.

This use case is helpful for managing task groups programmatically, such as setting up project boards or automating workflow stages.
